/**
 * @file   apps/server/src/realtime/inOrder.ts
 * @module server/realtime
 * @brief  Runs async calls one after another in arrival order (per socket intents, 06 §4.1).
 *
 * Responsibility: wrap an async handler so a later call starts only after the earlier one
 *                 has finished, whatever their durations. The gateway uses one per socket,
 *                 so an unwatch followed at once by a watch cannot leave the room after
 *                 joining it (found by the real-game play-through).
 * Depends on:     nothing
 * Used by:        ./gateway
 * Spec:           docs/spec/06-data-model-api-realtime.md §4.3; Bingo 06 §4.1
