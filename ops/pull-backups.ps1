# @file   ops/pull-backups.ps1
# @module ops
# @brief  Copies the server's encrypted backups to this Windows PC (scp over SSH).
#
# Responsibility: run on the operator's own computer: fetch every backup file of one
#                 environment that is not here yet from /var/backups/smg/<env>/ on the
#                 server into a local folder (default: Documents\smg-backups\<env>). Each
#                 file is copied as <name>.part, its size compared with the server's, and
#                 only then renamed, so an interrupted copy never looks like a backup. No
#                 backup on the server yet is a plain message, not an error. The files stay
#                 age-encrypted; only the operator's age key opens them. Needs the OpenSSH
#                 client that ships with Windows 10/11 and an SSH key the server accepts for
#                 a user in the group smg-backup (no root login needed).
# Spec:           docs/spec/10-repository-structure.md section 6; Bingo 09 section 6, section 9; docs/operator-guide.md
