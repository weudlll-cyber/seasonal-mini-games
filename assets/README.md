# Brand Assets — Manifest

Source assets. Build steps copy optimized versions into the apps; files here are never edited in place.

> **Licence note:** the Seasonal Tokens logo, season icons and the Luxora Grotesk font belong to the Seasonal Tokens project. They were copied unchanged from the Seasonal Bingo Royale repository (master `d294585`), which took them from the Seasonal Entertainment website repository, where the same files are public. They are not covered by this repository's AGPL licence. Operators can replace the branding in the admin panel (Appearance → Branding).
